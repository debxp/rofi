# About

Some of my personal rofi scripts...

## rofi-launcher

Simple script to launch rofi and some modi scripts (``rofi-modi-find``, i.e.).

## rofi-modi-find

Script called by ``rofi-launcher`` to find folders. With rofi running, use ``Ctrl+Tab`` to switch to the other modi scripts.  

## rofi-find

Standalone version of ``rofi-modi-find``. Can be assigned directly to a shortcut key.
